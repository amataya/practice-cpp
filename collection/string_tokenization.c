// People working with strings in C using the standard library
// should familiarize themselves with the Snobol-inspired functions
// strspn, strcspn and strpbrk.
//
// The actions of strtok can easily be coded using strspn and strcspn.
// strspn(s, bag) calculates the length of the prefix of string s which
// consists only of the characters in string bag.
// strcspn(s, bag) calculates the length of the prefix of s consisting of
// characters not in bag.
//
// The bag is like a one-character regex class; so that is to
// say strspn(s, "abcd") is like calculating the length of the token at the
// front of input s matching the regex [abcd]* , and in the case of strcspn,
// that becomes [^abcd]* .
// Itâ€™s nicer, since you can pass in a const char * and use it in concurrent code.

//
// strtok is broken. It's not thread safe (yes there is strtok_r). That's
// because it uses a static buffer internally. It's needlessly hard to use.
// And it writes zeros to the input array. The latter means it's unfit for most
// use cases, including non-trivial tokenization where you want e.g.
// to split "a+1" into three tokens.
